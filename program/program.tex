  {\bf Schedule:}\\[1ex]
  We divide the session into 3 parts, the first discussing
  past/published projects, the second ongoing projects and the third
  one future projects. The format will be that each session will have
  one person who presents a collection of slides (2-3 slides per
  project) on all corresponding projects in that category
  (past,ongoing,future). The presentation should not take longer than
  15 minutes. Afterwards we will have 5 minutes for immediate
  questions. At the end of the session, we will then have 30 minutes
  for in-depth discussion.\\[1ex]
  Slides:\\[1ex]
  Please prepare 2-3 slides on each of your projects with the main
  idea, relation to experiments and a sketch of the methods/tools
  involved. Unfortunately, there won't be time to go into depth for
  the methods. We should rather get an overview which methods are/were
  already employed at our institute in order to see where we can find
  cross-links or further methods for future projects. In addition to
  the content of future projects, we will also discuss their
  organization.

  In this session we will focus on the metadata annotation for the Vision for Action project (Marseille), and on the definition of an odML draft for that experiment. We also need to start thinking about who will be responsible for the curation of the metadata. We want to emphasize that we will not implement the odML during this session, as that would not be feasible. This task will rather serve as a concrete example and will be the starting point for a more general discussion about the usage of odML in the experimental collaborations of the INM-6. This has been the source of a lot of frustration for all sides in the past, and we want to come up with some ideas on how to improve the situation.
  Notes:

  In this session we discuss the available options to improve and extend medium and long range connectivity estimates.
  Both the classical tracing studies and new techniques for measuring long range connectivity will be discussed:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item (Rembrandt) Toolbox by Piotr Majka to create a Marmoset atlas of cortical connections \url{http://marmoset.braincircuits.org}. Can we move CoCoMac into this direction?
  \item (Rembrandt) Diffusion MRI based probabilistic or deterministic fiber tracking (DTI). Should we embrace this as a comprehensive technique that covers the whole brain at once \url{http://atlas.brainnetome.org/}, or dismiss it as a low resolution indirect measure that produces pretty pictures with questionable underpinnings \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnana.2015.00061}?
  \item (Sacha) Polarized Light Imaging data, a technique that provides a similar measure as DTI, but at hundred times higher resolution, at least in the 2D sectioning plane. How long will it take the PLI team to build a PLI "big brain" which reconstructs 3D volumes from 2D slices?
  \item (Nicole) Patchy connectivity in medium-range cortical connectivity, how does it come about and should it be part of the next multi area model?

  {\bf Proposed participants:} Inga, Robin, Michael B, Emiliano, Jannis, Carlos, Tom, Jakob, Luca, Jeyashree\\[1ex]
  	{\bf Schedule:}\\[1ex]
	The idea is to study concrete examples where techniques from our
	work can be applied to other fields (and what we can learn from other
	related fields). The main focus should be on networks of spiking
	neurons, i.e., how to construct and how to analyze them.  The
	session will be composed of short presentations of examples 		from literature/experience, discussions and the development of concrete ideas.\\
